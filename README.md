## welcome to Catmosphere! 

for hackmit 2023, we wanted to make a game with (1) cats and (2) cool art. inspired by the many "cozy indie" games on steam and on social media, we got working on a game where the cat has to avoid all the obstacles as it attempts to go into outer space. 

**what it does**: use the WASD keys to navigate our cat around the enemies. enter the five levels of the atmosphere and enjoy the art and music while you're at it! 

**what's next for Catmosphere**: adding more levels, a restart button, & a new soundtrack and artwork

**UPDATE: Catmosphere won best hack for the beginner track at HackMIT 2023!

**designed by first years at MIT: 
- kenneth chap
- helena de figueiredo valente
- nigel norman
- dominique dang
